    <title>Designs that Celebrate Wood by Jordan Cady</title>
</head>
<!-- What's something simple I could make that does not require internet but would be useful practice for me? I was
thinking mainly of practicing my CSS skills which might be annoying if I cannot read the manual pages online. In other
notes, I COULD turn on my hotspot...

    <h2>About the Designs</h2>
    <p>"The woods are never solitary--they are full of whispering, beckoning, friendly life." L.M. Montgomery</p>
    <p>"In the woods, we return to reason and faith." Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
    <p>"Wood, if you stop to think of it, has been man's best friend in the world. It held him in his cradle, went to war as the gunstock in his hand, was the frame of the bed he came to rejoicing, the log upon his hearth when he was cold...it is the forest where he seeks sanctuary from a stony world." Donald Culross Peattie</p>
    <p>Jordan Cady's objective is to celebrate each piece of wood he finds. Once a piece of wood is selected, he spends time observing its natural veins, the bends it built as it grew and the particular colors it exhibits before he decides to what task he will put it.</p>
   <!-- Insert section about the things Jordan has already made: tables and cutting boards and spoons. Talk about why he has a passion for those kinds of things,
        especially spoons and tables: "he loves the items that gather people around a table, that bring people together. The friendliness and enduring strength of wood
        is something Jordan wants the world to celebrate with him." -->

        "To this day I think that there is nothing as interesting to look at as a heap of newly cut logs, the delicate colouring of their veined insides telling their life story, while they wait to bring warmth and comfort." Alice Taylor
        "Every species of tree has its voice as well as its feature." Thomas Hardy
        "Wood is universally beautiful to man. It is the most humanly intimate of all materials." Frank Lloyd Wright
